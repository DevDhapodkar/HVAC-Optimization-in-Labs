# HVAC Optimization in Labs

This project focuses on optimizing cooling needs in laboratory environments using machine learning. It features a Decision Tree model to forecast cooling requirements based on occupancy and temperature data, visualized through a Streamlit dashboard with zone-wise heatmaps.

## Features
- **Predictive Modeling**: Decision Tree Regressor for cooling load forecasting.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time zone forecasts and heatmaps.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Customizable lab environment simulator.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the dashboard:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
